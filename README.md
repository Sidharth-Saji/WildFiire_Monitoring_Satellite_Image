# WildFiire Detection Using Satellite Image

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on detecting wildfires using satellite imagery.The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms and techniques to accurately identify regions affected by wildfires.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a wildfire detection model that can analyze satellite images and identify areas prone to wildlifes.we aim to detect and predict wildfires at a certain place.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the project:

+ Python 3.6+
+ Numpy
+ Pandas
+ Os.path
+ TensorFlow
+ Pathlib
+ Keras
+ Matplotlib
+ Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install __Python 3.6__ or a higher version if not already installed.
3. install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the wildlife detection system,
follow the steps below:

1. Acquire satellite images or use the provided sample dataset.
2. preprocess the satellite images, including resizing, normalization, and enhancement techniques.
3. load the pre-trained wildfire detection model using the code provided.
4. Apply the model to the preprocessed satellite images to identify wildfire regions.
5. Visualize and analyze the detected wildfire regions using the provided tools.
